Hello, I have taken the time to compile a rather useful csv file that organizes the 11.2.0 WoW API from all the .lua source files from Gethe/wow-ui-source
the python script and the csv file should be downloaded to the same folder then simply run the python script and a clean GUI opens and you can enter a function
name to search.

The search results are displayed in the GUI window, scrollable, and best of all each match hyprelinks to the https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/tree/live/Interface/AddOns
site and highlights the line the function is found on so you can see all it's parameters etc directly from the source. 

This is built for 11.2.0 -- The last time I did this was for 11.1.0 while working on my OldGods addon, I have made it cleaner and easier for all, enjoy!
